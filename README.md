# CISC3014-IR-and-WebSearch-Project
This is a school project from UM.

## Rotten Tomatoes
&emsp; I finally realized that my stock shit is not gonna work. It's too simple and can't do a shit. So I decided to change the topic.
&emsp; The new topic is about movie classification. To be specific, it classifies the movies I scrapped from rotten tomatoes according to critic sentiment, from conditions among:
audient score, audient sentiment, and critic score. I would probably do some tf-idf document query stuff if I still got time. Good luck to myself.

&emsp; The old one's still there, take a look:

## Some Ideas (Temporary):
&emsp; This project is temporarily given an idea of scraping stock information.
It would scrape 10 important indecies from Xueqiu.

&emsp; ```get_stock.py``` is the main file.
